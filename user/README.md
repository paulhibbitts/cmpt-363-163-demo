The **Course Hub** skeleton is intended to accompany a face-to-face, blended or fully online university course. It supports a [flipped-LMS approach](http://hibbittsdesign.org/blog/posts/flipped-lms-using-an-open-and-collaborative-platform) using the modern flat-file (no database) Grav CMS as an open and collaborative Web platform.

## Flipping your LMS with the Grav Course Hub

### Why Flip your LMS with Grav?
* To support pedagogical goals unmet by current LMS/platform
* To deliver a better student (and facilitator) experience
* To increase capability of access, sharing and collaboration

### Why Use a Modern flat-file CMS?
As an open source modern flat-file CMS, Grav offers a distinct set of advantages to Web-savvy educators looking to move beyond their institutional LMS:
* Modern means...
  * Modern PHP code (i.e. reliability, speed, extensibility, etc.)
  * Use of current standards (i.e. Markdown, Twig, YAML, etc.)
  * Modular/customizable content chunks (i.e. reuse of content)
  * Further separation of content (i.e. files) from presentation
* Flat-file means...
  * No database means less (or no) IT involvement needed
  * Content stored in text files rather than in a database
  * Takes full advantage of the collaborative ecosystem now available (i.e. GitHub)
  * Increased portability, as moving a site now only requires simply copying files to another location
  * All template and content files are 100% version controllable

### Course Hub Highlights
* A complete ready-to-run Grav package (open source)
* Blog-format, with 'featured' (sticky) posts
* [Single course](http://hibbittsdesign.org/demo/grav-course-hub-bootstrap/) per Hub, [multiple courses](http://hibbittsdesign.org/demo/grav-multi-course-blog-hub/) per Hub or even [multiple course sub-sites](http://hibbittsdesign.org/demo/grav-multi-course-pages-hub/) (blog + multiple pages per course) per Hub
* Optional important reminders & class preparations areas
* Hub pages can be easily added/removed/changed
* Uses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for streamlined cross-platform content
* Image header area above Hub navigation bar
* Sidebar is a simple markdown file, which can also contain HTML
* URL flag to only display page content (for display within LMS). For example, [http://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-course-hub-bootstrap/home/week-03/onlydisplaypagecontent:true](http://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-course-hub-bootstrap/home/week-03/onlydisplaypagecontent:true)
* External links are automatically opened in a new Tab/Window
* Built-in support for entire Hub to be collaboratively maintained on GitHub or GitLab (for local hosting)
* Since everything is built with Grav it can be _entirely_ customized

## Grav Course Hub Installation  

### Quick Install (Web server only)

### Recommended Install (Desktop + Server)
With the flat-file (no database) nature of Grav, there are lots of benefits of installing Grav on your computer and then having your site files mirrored onto a Web server:
* Always have access to your site, regardless of Web server status
* Develop and test changes to your site privately without any downtime of the live site
* Store your site files on a Git service (i.e. GitHub) to better track your development and enable anywhere, anytime editing of your site
* Enable others (i.e. students, fellow instructors, colleagues, etc.) to collaboratively contribute to the site, including both site content _and_ code

**Pre-flight Checklist**  

1. Confirm Web server PHP version (PHP 5.5.9 or higher)  
2. Web server login credentials (username and password)  
3. Download and install MAMP   ([https://www.mamp.info/](https://www.mamp.info/))  
4. Git server account (e.g. GitHub ([https://github.com/](https://github.com)) or local GitLab or Gogs app, etc.)  
5. Download and install GitHub Desktop ([https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/))  
6. Automatic deployment service (e.g. Deploy ([https://www.deployhq.com/](https://www.deployhq.com/)) or Buddy ([https://buddy.works/](https://buddy.works)))  

**Desktop Installation Steps**  

1. Download the ready-to-run [Course Hub Skeleton Package](http://hibbittsdesign.org/blog/downloads/grav-skeleton-course-hub-site.zip)
2. Unzip the Grav package onto your desktop
3. Create a folder called 'MAMP Websites' in your 'Documents' folder
4. Copy the _entire_ Grav folder into your 'MAMP Websites' folder
5. Launch MAMP
6. Change the 'Document Root' MAMP preferences setting to the 'MAMP Websites' folder (within 'Documents')
7. Press the MAMP 'Start Servers' button

Once you have confirmed that Grav is running locally on your computer, the final step is to create a Git server repository to store your site files and setup an automatic deployment service to push any changed files to your Web server. An example step-by-step walkthrough this process is available in the article [Using Grav with GitHub Desktop](http://hibbittsdesign.org/blog/posts/using-grav-with-github).
